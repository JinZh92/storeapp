      the aim was to create a space for tabletop culture: a venue where guests could revisit a rainy-day classic from their youth <br><br>

      Above all, we want people to have fun! Throughout our history, we've been deeply involved in local community, working together with the Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Public Library as well as with Greater Toronto Area youth groups. Our annual Catanathon raises thousands of dollars for charity while simultaneously subjecting our staff to a grueling mental battery.  <br><br>

      The concept has caught fire worldwide, sponsoring board game caf√©s and bars as close as Montreal and as far-flung as Bahrain naming us as their inspiration. It may seem silly, but we're ecstatic that board games are transcending borders both physical and cultural, and we believe that it's not where you're playing, but who you're playing with.

      What does the future hold? We don't know, but we'd love for you to be there as we find out.
